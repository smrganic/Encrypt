# Encrypt

This is a simple command line program written in C. I wanted to make something interesting and at the same time practice for my exam. This is the result.

The program can encrypt and decrypt text files using the caesar and viginere cypher. I also added some other basic funcionality like removing and renaming files.

The exam included some structs so I had to include that aswell. The plan was to make something like a phonebook filled with users and allow encryption but I never finished that funcionality because I passed my exam so it seemed redundant.
